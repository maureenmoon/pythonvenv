President Trump’s decision to strike Iran without congressional authorization and little consultation has divided Congress and deepened rifts inside both parties, touching off a searing debate over the role of the military and how much power the legislative branch should wield over the use of American forces.

Some leading Democrats have reacted with outrage at Mr. Trump’s unilateral authorization, calling it an unconstitutional overstepping of his authority and demanding a briefing and a swift vote on whether to approve any further military action in Iran. Top Republicans, who have rushed to cede congressional power to the president at the start of his term, have instead called the strikes on Iran justified and appropriate, arguing that Congress should have no say in the matter.

“The commander in chief has Article II responsibilities,” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters on Monday, referring to the section of the Constitution covering presidential power.

Voicing strong opposition to voting on a bipartisan measure to reassert Congress’s war powers, he continued: “They’re very serious and important, especially in times like this. I think he used that authority judiciously.”
